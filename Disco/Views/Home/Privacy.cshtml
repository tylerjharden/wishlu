    Personal Information:
    GENERAL STATEMENT AND USE OF AGGREGATE INFORMATION
    As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual's activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, App and our Services when directly linked to personally identifiable information.  Personal information also includes demographic information, such as, without limitation, date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information.  Aggregate information is data we collect about the use of the Site, the App, or our Services, or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed or otherwise “de-identified.”  Therefore, information about how you use a service or feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service or feature.  Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new services and features or otherwise tailor the Site, the App, and our Services.  This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, which may be used freely without restriction.
    PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED:
    We collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our Site, the App or use our Services.  For example, at several different places on our Site and in our App, we may collect certain data you provide to us which may contain personal information.  For example, we may collect your name, address, age, gender, photograph and possibly other contact and demographic information when you:  (1) register and set up an account;  (2) sign up for any of our e-mail services;  (3) post, tweet, or share user content on Facebook or Twitter;  (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason;  (5) check in via foursquare;  (6) enable geo-location tracking; (7) sign in via Facebook or Twitter; enable push notifications;  8) enable push notifications to personal email inbox
    or (9) change your settings to get notifications in WishLu inbox.  Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile, leaving comments, providing a review, inviting a friend, accepting an invitation from a friend, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forum or feature on the site or in an ancillary mobile application.
