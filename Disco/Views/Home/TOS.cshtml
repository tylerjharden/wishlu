    <h4>wishlu&rsquo;s Terms, Conditions and Policy</h4>
    <h5>Privacy Policy</h5>
    <p>
        This privacy policy ("Policy") explains when and how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to our web site located at
        <a href="http://www.wishlu.com">www.wishlu.com</a> (the "Site"), our ancillary mobile applications (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;), and any other wishlu services (our &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).
        By using the Site, the App, and the Services you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us.  Further, by
        using the Site, App and our Services, you consent to giving wishlu all rights necessary to enable other users to sync with your user device and/or personal
        information.

        <strong>
            WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS POLICY AT ANY TIME.  WE WILL ALERT YOU THAT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE BY INDICATING ON THE PRIVACY POLICY THE
            DATE IT WAS LAST UPDATED.  YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND THE APP FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF SUCH CHANGES OR REVISED STATEMENT SHALL CONSTITUTE YOUR CONSENT TO ANY CHANGES
            IN OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES.
        </strong>

        Please carefully review this policy whenever you visit our Site or when you use the App so you understand our data privacy practices and can make an informed decision
        about using our Site, the App, or Services.&#8224;
    </p>

    <h5>Personal Information</h5>
    <h6>GENERAL STATEMENT AND USE OF AGGREGATE INFORMATION</h6>
    <p>
        As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, e-mail address, or other
        account number), and information about that individual's activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, App and our Services when directly
        linked to personally identifiable information.  Personal information also includes demographic information, such as, without limitation, date of birth, gender,
        geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate"
        information.  Aggregate information is data we collect about the use of the Site, the App, or our Services, or about a group or category of products, services or
        users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed or otherwise &ldquo;de-identified.&rdquo;  Therefore, information about how you use a
        service or feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service or feature.  Aggregate data helps us understand trends and
        our users' needs so that we can better consider new services and features or otherwise tailor the Site, the App, and our Services.  This policy in no way restricts
        or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, which may be used freely without restriction.
    </p>

    <h6>PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</h6>
    <p>
        We collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our Site, the App or use our Services.  For example, at several different places on our Site and
        in our App, we may collect certain data you provide to us which may contain personal information.  For example, we may collect your name, address, age, gender,
        photograph and possibly other contact and demographic information when you:  (1) register and set up an account;  (2) sign up for any of our e-mail services;
        (3) post, tweet, or share user content on Facebook or Twitter;  (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason;  (5) check in via foursquare;  (6) enable geo-location
        tracking; (7) sign in via Facebook or Twitter; enable push notifications;  8) enable push notifications to personal email inbox or (9) change your settings to
        get notifications in wishlu inbox.  Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile, leaving
        comments, providing a review, inviting a friend, accepting an invitation from a friend, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any
        interactive forum or feature on the site or in an ancillary mobile application.  In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other
        personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers and/or discounts, and other
        activities on the Site and in the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you visit our web site, some information is automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, identification of your
        computer's operating system and user device, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and participation.  Further,
        still other information is collected when you use the wishlu App, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, device type and specifications (including the
        screen resolution capability, identity of your operating system, IMEI and device identification).  We treat this information as personal information, and we use it
        to, among other things, ensure that our Site and App are secure and working properly.  Of course, if we de-identify and combine this information with or link it
        to any other information, it will be treated and used as aggregate information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies".  For more information on how we use cookies, please see the section below entitled
